                <p>Odyssey I ultimately achieved it’s intended purpose as an early solar-system probe, gathering valuable information on many of our planets within our system. It was a success story that helped pave the way for scientific advancement in future probe projects.

                    It’s anomalous crash has been subject to numerous conspiracy theories, leading to confusion amongst the public around the incident itself.
                    
                    These rumors, often started by malfeasants, have proven to be false. Such as a permanent military installation hidden within the park around the <span class="crash"><a href="https://nicolemachnowski.github.io/Odyssey-Mission/page4/index.html">crash site-</a></span> causing much of the park to be inaccessible to the public.</p>
                    
                    <p>There have also been unfounded claims of park goers going missing near the crash site in the time surrounding the crash and post clean-up and containment of the site.
                    
                    These malicious rumors have led to false narratives surrounding the crash, including confusion around the truth behind the crash. Caused by computational errors within the probe’s navigational systems, it’s thrusters that were meant to plunge it into Neptune’s atmosphere had caused it to loop back towards Earth. </p>
