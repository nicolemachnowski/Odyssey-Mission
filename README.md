Welcome to Odyssey Mission!

This file has started as my senior BFA Design project for Rutgers' Mason Gross School of the Arts, but I plan to continue to expand upon this project-- so consider it a living document.

I will upload the PDF of the book online for others to access outside of the thesis show at a later date, but if you are reading this-- please use the book for hints on how to navigate the website, or just peruse it at your leisure!

Thank you for taking the time to view my project!
