                    <p>The Odyssey Mission stood to provide the world with knowledge of our solar system, serving as a stepping stone for future missions. 
    
                        However, it was our duty to keep the public safe as well. The secrecy around the crash site brought with it suspicion, but we ultimately had to prioritize public health and safety.</p>
    
                    <p>Odyssey serves as a reminder to us all of the risks that have come with the era of space travel and exploration. Our scientists, engineers, and physicists have worked tirelessly to help broaden the horizons of space travel, helping us gain a greater understanding of our universe each and every single day. Without their labors, without their <span class="sacrifice"><a href="https://nicolemachnowski.github.io/Odyssey-Mission/doc2/index.html">sacrifice,</a></span> we would not be where we are at now.</p>
    
                    <p>Odyssey I was a priceless source of new knowledge, allowing us to have a greater understanding of the objects of our solar system. Up until the Voyager program, Odyssey had traveled further than any other object or man sent up into space. It was a scientific marvel, and a testament to the knowledge of humanity and the dedication of our scientific teams back here on Earth. </p>
