               <p>The Odyssey Project began as the Odyssey I mission in the early 1970s. A mission that served as a precursor to the more notable Voyager missions. Odyssey I was an early prototype of a deep space probe, sent to make observations of our solar system and to gather data from areas beyond the inner asteroid belt and beyond. </p>

                <p>The project was initially marked with success, gathering valuable data that informed future probe projects and missions. However, on the <span class="night"><a href="page3.html">night</a></span> of May 19th, 1979, the probe had unexpectedly crashed in Glen Hope State Park in Northwest New Jersey.

                    At the crash site, teams of scientists involved in the project were escorted by military personnel to investigate the cause of the sudden return to Earth and its eventual demise.</p>

                <p>Despite this loss, Odyssey has provided valuable data and recordings of our solar system. It served as a precursor for future deep-space probe programs, and gave us a further understanding of planets, asteroids, and other satellites within our solar system.</p>
